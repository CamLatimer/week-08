## Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `BlogPost` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency. Use Angular code style conventions.

**Your answer:**
```
(function(){
  angular
  .module('BlogPost', [
    'ui.router'
  ]);
  }());
```

## Question 2

Given a custom directive whose `link` function contains the line:

```js
scope.status = "Click";
```

Which *one* of the following buttons would *not* be displayed?

```html
[ ] A: <button data-ng-if="status">Click</button>
[ ] B: <button data-ng-show="status">Click</button>
[x] C: <button data-ng-hide="status">Click</button>
[] D: <button>{{status}}</button>
```

## Question 3

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="create()">Click</button>
```

**Your answer:**
```
using 'data' in front of ng-click will allow one to use angular directives and keep
the html validator compliant.
```

## Question 4

Which of the following demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

**Your answer:**
A. is the best usage because the app can be implemented all over the page instead
of the just between the head tags or one div element.  
> ...

### A:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### B:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### C:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 5

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh, and a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[x] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

## Question 6

What is an IIFE, and why might you use it?

**Your answer:**
```
An IIFE is an immediately invoked function expression.  It's function that runs
as soon as it is defined.  You might use one to keep variables from cluttering the
global scope of your program and making sure there aren't problems with variables
when the code is minified.
```

## Question 7

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

**Your answer:**
```
'ui-sref' is a directive that is part of the ui-router Angular module.  It binds
an html tag to a state
> ...

## Question 8

One of the lines of code in the following snippet will throw an error. Which one is it, and why?

**Your answer:**

> ...

```
Line three throws the error.  I needs to be defined explicitly using the var
keyword.

/*1*/ "use strict";
/*2*/ var max = 100;
/*3*/ for(i = 1; i < max; i++){
/*4*/   if(i % 15 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz");
/*5*/   else if(i % 3 == 0) console.log("Fizz");
/*6*/   else if(i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");
/*7*/   else console.log(i);
/*8*/ }
```

## Question 9

Custom directives can be embedded in HTML four different ways. Demonstrate **two** of these four with a directive called `my-directive`. (Hint: "MACE")

**Your answer:**
```
'A' as an attribute:
<div class='my-directive'></div>

'E' as an elemente:
<my-directive></my-directive>

```

## Question 10

Of the three following options, which is the most "correct" way of organizing the files that make up an Angular app? Why is this option considered "better" than the other two?

**Your answer:**
```
Option 'B' would be better because the file and directory names are descriptive and
allow for the ability to quickly find, view, and access files that are linked
by dependencies or features/functionality.
